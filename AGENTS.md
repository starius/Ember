# Ember development guide

This file applies to the whole repository. It records the working practices that have
proved useful while debugging search, SMP, time management, Syzygy, opening-book, and
deployment behavior.

Treat this as a living document. When a repeatable development, debugging, or
quality-assurance practice proves useful, update this file as part of the same work. Keep
the guidance general and actionable rather than tied to one incident, and revise or remove
advice when the repository's workflow changes.

## Guiding principle

Treat a bad game, a suspicious move, an NPS change, and an Elo result as different kinds
of evidence. Reproduce the behavior, identify the responsible subsystem, add the narrowest
useful regression, and only then change the engine. A plausible chess explanation is not
yet a code bug, and a faster benchmark is not proof of greater playing strength.

Use this dependency chain as the default mental model:

```text
observation
  -> preserve artifacts and exact configuration
  -> locate the first meaningful divergence
  -> reproduce it deterministically
  -> classify the responsible subsystem
  -> add regression coverage
  -> make the smallest causal change
  -> pass correctness checks
  -> compare NPS and search shape
  -> compare playing strength and clock safety
  -> build and smoke-test deliverables
```

Do not skip directly from an anecdotal game result to a broad search heuristic change.

### Stable behavioral baseline

Treat the previous release tag as Ember's stable behavioral baseline: the latest tag marks
the most recent known-good state, so the baseline rolls forward with every release instead
of pinning one version. For every proposed change that can affect move choice, measure
fixtures and playing strength as change vs pre-change: compare the candidate against the
exact revision the edit started from — the previous HEAD, or N commits back when one
change spans several commits. Fixtures and SPRT never run against an older release unless
the change itself starts there. A flip against the pre-change revision is a regression to
investigate before accepting the change.

The pre-change comparison is a floor, not an oracle. Do not restore the pre-change move
when strong analysis shows that the newer move is better, and do not preserve a known old
bug. Record the evidence whenever an intentional change breaks a previously passing
pre-change case. Use `tools/compare_fixture_corpus.py` to compare active position
regressions across two binaries.
Run disabled report-only rows explicitly when their requested depths fit the available
budget. This UCI-level comparison supplements rather than replaces the in-process fixture
suite; investigate any difference between those paths instead of silently choosing the more
convenient result.

## Workspace and reproducibility

- Inspect the branch, worktree, and recent history before editing. Preserve unrelated
  tracked changes and all user-owned untracked files.
- Never use destructive Git operations to clean a shared worktree. Do not rewrite history
  below a base the user has declared stable.
- Record exact revisions, build flags, CPU model, logical CPU count, thread count, hash size,
  books, tablebase paths, time controls, seeds, and commands. A result without this context
  is hard to compare or reproduce.
- Identify any uncommitted experiment explicitly in its result directory; a revision name
  alone does not identify a dirty tree.
- Preserve raw logs, PGNs, JSON summaries, engine traces, and benchmark output needed to
  audit a conclusion.
- For long differential comparisons, record each batch invocation, complete
  transcript, and successful exit status. Resume only after verifying those
  artifacts against the original inputs and binaries; preserve interrupted
  partial captures separately.
- Propagate background output-reader and transcript-write failures to validation callers.
  Keep draining subprocess pipes after a logging failure, reap the process, and reject
  incomplete captures even when the subprocess exits successfully.
- Long-running adaptive tools must persist the exact invocation and active work item before
  launching it. Keep result application idempotent, replace state files atomically, and test
  interruption between each durable write so a restart can reconcile rather than repeat or
  lose completed work.
- Validate complete configuration, persisted inputs, and selected names before creating
  durable state or starting expensive work. When configuration names an external interface,
  probe that interface during preflight instead of trusting a duplicated local name list.
- Whenever documentation, reports, plans, fixture comments, tests, or PR prose reference an
  externally hosted game, include its full clickable URL. A bare game ID is not sufficient.
- Do not run two CPU-bound comparisons concurrently on the same machine. They contaminate
  timing and NPS results.

## Regression policy

### Keep public behavior tests outside `src/`

Tests embedded under `src/` are reserved for focused unit tests and microbenchmarks of
private, low-level implementation details that cannot be reached through the crate's public
surface. A test that uses only exported `ember_chess` modules, types, functions, and methods
belongs under `tests/`, even when it exercises behavior implemented by a single source
module. Public subsystem lifecycle and cross-module behavior are integration tests, not
inline unit tests.

Do not make an implementation detail public solely to relocate a test. When an inline test
needs a chess position, comment the private contract it observes and why a public integration
test or TSV move fixture would lose that contract. When touching an inline test module,
recheck that every remaining test actually depends on private behavior; move public-only
coverage out instead of adding more source-module test infrastructure.

### Chess move regressions belong in TSV fixtures

Represent a position in `tests/fixtures/*.tsv` whenever the assertion is fundamentally
"in this chess history or position, Ember should choose or avoid these moves." Do not add a
one-off Rust test for a case that can be represented losslessly in this format.

The fixture runner automatically discovers every regular `.tsv` file directly under
`tests/fixtures/`. Adding a row or another TSV fixture must not require a Rust change. All
fixture files use this header:

```text
id	depth	fen_before_blunder	setup_move	expected_move	themes	rating	popularity	plays
```

Fixture conventions:

- IDs must be descriptive and globally unique across all fixture files.
- A fixture file may declare `# Variant: Chess960` before the header. The row format stays
  unchanged, but the runner must set Chess960 mode before loading each FEN from that file.
  Omit the directive for normal chess.
- Put a comment immediately before every hand-written regression. Explain the source,
  link to the game or report when possible, state what went wrong, and state the intended
  invariant. Separate hand-written cases with an empty line.
- Use `-` for no setup move. Otherwise use one UCI move or a space-separated UCI move
  history.
- Preserve the full move history when repetition, the fifty-move counter, castling rights,
  en-passant state, or other history-sensitive behavior matters. A final FEN alone is not
  always an equivalent reproducer.
- `expected_move` accepts one exact move, alternatives separated by `|`, or forbidden
  moves after `!`. Prefer an invariant such as "do not play the losing move" when several
  continuations are sound.
- Use depth `0` for an embedded-book regression. It requires the expected move to be
  returned immediately with zero search nodes. Depths `1` through `64` disable the book
  and run a normal fixed-depth search. Choose the lowest stable search depth that still
  exercises the bug, unless the failure itself depends on a documented deployment-like
  depth. Depth-based cases should remain deterministic and reasonably cheap.
- Keep source metadata in `themes`, `rating`, `popularity`, and `plays` when it exists. Use
  neutral zero values for hand-written cases where it does not.
- If a valuable position still fails and no generally safe fix exists, keep a commented-out
  row with a `DISABLED` explanation. Do not weaken an active assertion merely to make an
  unsafe engine change appear green.
- Before prioritizing mined or externally sourced disabled cases, verify their expected
  moves with a current strong reference engine at a recorded search budget. Keep supported
  cases separate from disagreements and near-ties so Ember is not tuned to an obsolete or
  subjective label.
- Do not duplicate a TSV move regression in Rust.

Before adding a position-backed Rust test, first try to express it as a TSV case. A fixed
position or legal move history plus an exact, alternative, or forbidden root move belongs
in TSV, including immediate embedded-book choices. If a position remains in a Rust test,
add a nearby comment naming the non-TSV contract it observes, such as an internal ordering
score, extension eligibility and counterexamples, synthetic SMP worker ballots,
transposition state, node accounting, or direct tablebase probing. Such a test belongs under
`src/` only when that contract requires private implementation access; otherwise put it
under `tests/`. The position alone is not a reason to keep a regression in Rust.

Use Rust tests for behavior the TSV schema cannot express: UCI protocol ordering, stop and
ponder lifecycle, clock budgets, thread coordination, node accounting, option handling,
resource cleanup, parser behavior, and other subsystem invariants. Python tooling and the
deployment tooling should have their regressions in their existing Python test suites.

For UCI option aliases, exercise the production executable and assert a diagnostic from
the shared handler; `readyok` alone does not prove that an option was recognized. Capture
stdout and stderr independently and collect both streams before asserting diagnostics,
because they have no shared ordering guarantee.

The fast fixture test validates the TSV schema, numeric fields, and cross-file ID uniqueness.
The ignored in-process release fixture test runs every active hard-layer case from
`engine_regressions.tsv`. Soft active cases are judged by the two-binary fixture gate, which
preserves every pass/fail flip and applies the selected baseline-relative policy.

## Diagnosing a bad game or move

1. Preserve the original PGN and engine artifacts. Prefer raw UCI output and clocks over a
   reconstructed account from the board alone.
2. Confirm the exact Ember binary or revision and all UCI options. Check book, Threads,
   Hash, Ponder, SyzygyPath, and the real time control.
3. Find the first meaningful Ember divergence, not merely the move after the evaluation has
   already collapsed. Record the evaluation before and after each candidate from the same
   side-to-move convention.
4. Analyze the suspicious position with a strong Stockfish build at a stable, explicitly
   recorded node or depth budget. Compare Ember's move with the best alternative, then
   follow both lines for several moves. A shallow one-ply comparison is often misleading.
5. If Ember is already clearly better, run advantage-defense matches: make Ember play from
   the suspicious position and from nearby earlier positions against a stronger Stockfish
   with a larger clock. Use this to check whether the advantage is practically convertible
   or whether the opponent can expose a hidden search, tablebase, or fifty-move weakness.
   For corpus mining, use `tools/hunt_lost_advantage.py` and keep generated cases in
   `tests/fixtures/advantage_preservation.tsv` as disabled rows until a bucket is understood
   and fixed. Classify the failures before tuning search around individual positions.
6. Reproduce Ember's choice with the original move history and deployment settings. Then
   vary one dimension at a time: book on/off, one thread versus deployment threads, fixed
   depth versus clocked search, clean versus reused process, and tablebases on/off.
7. Compare the same position on known-good and candidate revisions with identical binaries,
   settings, and hardware. Use a targeted history search or bisect when the first bad
   revision is unknown.
   When several root moves collapse to the same fail-hard bound, use
   `tools/compare_mistake_trace.py` with a strong reference line to preserve the root DAG and
   locate the first unvisited witness position. Treat a bisected move-choice change as a
   search-shape boundary, not proof that the original predicate is still the active cause
   after later refactors.
8. Classify the failure before editing:

   - **Book:** Was the position actually in the book? Was the selected move legal, within
     the configured quality window, and evaluated from the correct side? Did the engine
     intentionally leave book or silently fail to load it?
   - **Time management:** Distinguish allocated search time from wall-clock time and UCI
     overhead. Inspect increment reserve, move overhead, soft/hard stops, predicted next
     iteration cost, ponder transitions, and time remaining after `bestmove`.
   - **SMP:** Check leader ownership of the final root move, worker stop propagation, stale
     results, root-lane assignment, aggregate node accounting, and whether worker activity
     ends promptly after `bestmove`.
   - **Search/evaluation:** If the same bad move is stable with one and many threads, suspect
     evaluation, selectivity, extensions/reductions, quiescence, transposition reuse, or
     horizon effects before blaming SMP.
   - **Persistent state:** Compare a fresh process with a process that has played the full
     game. Inspect history aging, cached root ordering, repetition state, transposition
     tables, and NNUE incremental state.
   - **Syzygy:** Verify the material count, complete WDL/DTZ availability, path contents,
     root probe result, fifty-move semantics, and the transition into smaller tablebases.
     A six-piece set is not a replacement for the three-to-five-piece files.
   - **Deployment infrastructure:** Separate engine failures from match scheduling, input
     stream termination, game aborts, harness state, and subprocess lifecycle failures.

Only fix behavior when the evidence identifies a bug or a defensible generally better
decision. If the root cause remains a broad finite-depth weakness, record the position and
the competing hypotheses instead of tuning narrowly to one game.

## Correctness gates

Run checks in increasing cost order and stop on a real failure:

1. `cargo fmt --all --check`
2. The narrow unit, integration, fixture, or Python test covering the change
3. `cargo check --locked --all-features`
4. `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
5. `cargo test --locked --all-features -- --test-threads=1` with the repository's documented
   stack limits
6. The ignored in-process hard-layer move-fixture suite when chess behavior changed
7. Relevant old-CPU, cross-architecture, packaging, or deployment tests

Use the Nix `ci` shell where CI does. Match `.github/workflows/ci.yml` rather than inventing
a subtly different command.

Every bug fix should have a regression at the narrowest useful layer. A regression proves
the causal invariant, not just that the final game happens to end differently.

When a Python test compares exact file or archive bytes, create its fixture with
`Path.write_bytes`. Text-mode writes translate newlines on Windows and can change the
bytes the test meant to verify.

When adding a foreign NNUE architecture, first require exact integer-score parity with the
compatible reference engine on varied positions. Separately test that static evaluation,
the main search, and SMP workers select that network instead of silently falling back to a
native network or classic evaluation. Benchmark the incremental feature update path; a
correct full-refresh evaluator is an oracle, not a production search implementation. When
several bit-exact implementations of the same accumulator update exist (full scan versus
incremental delta), per-node dispatch between them on a measured cost crossover is safe
because the accumulator state is identical either way, but the parity test must then walk
both dispatch sides along the same game sequences so every node class stays cross-validated
against the oracle.

When adding a special search ordering or extension, test both the intended motif and nearby
counterexamples that must not qualify. Prefer predicates that describe the candidate move
itself over a position-wide trigger such as "some rook check exists"; a broad trigger can
change the search of every unrelated root move. Run the complete move-fixture corpus after
changing eligibility, because several individually reasonable heuristics can overlap.

## Performance and playing-strength gates

Correctness, speed, search shape, clock safety, and Elo are separate gates. Report all
relevant ones; do not use one as a proxy for another.

### Reproducible comparisons

- Build baseline and candidate from explicit revisions with the same toolchain and release
  flags.
- Run them on the same otherwise-idle machine. Keep Hash, Threads, books, tablebases,
  openings, seeds, opponents, ponder mode, and time controls identical.
- Treat fixed-depth move choices as configuration-dependent results. In particular,
  transposition-table size changes replacement collisions and can change a principal
  variation without any UCI/library bug. Match the in-process fixture defaults when
  cross-checking through UCI, make deliberate overrides explicit, and record Hash in the
  result artifact.
- Use paired openings and swap colors. Fixed seeds make a rerun diagnostic rather than a
  new experiment.
- Warm up before timing and use multiple repetitions. Prefer medians and distributions over
  a single sample.
- When machine load can drift over minutes (desktop workload, background services), run the
  sides interleaved rather than sequentially: `tools/benchmark_search.py --interleave`
  alternates binaries per (repeat, position) sample and swaps which side goes first per
  block. Sequential scheduling measured the same engine pair as +21.9%, +5.1%, and -26.8%
  across three runs under a drifting desktop load; the interleaved schedule collapsed the
  spread to a stable estimate. Node counts are bit-exact between runs, so any NPS spread
  under identical trees is machine load, not engine behavior.
- On workstation CPUs, phase-cycle counters (per-node rdtsc regions) detect a code-level
  cost shift far more reliably than wall-clock NPS when the machine is not dedicated:
  counters are load-independent, and a genuinely cheaper path shows as attributed cycles
  shrinking. Watch the counter's "unattributed" bucket, though: layout and cache side
  effects can push part of the savings there, so pair counter deltas with at least one
  idle-machine NPS run before reporting a final number.
- Save the complete result directory, not just a summary copied into chat or a PR.
- Keep nested phase timings separate from top-level attributed totals. Compare
  strategies over the same scope of work, and distinguish architectural timer
  ticks from CPU cycles. Instrumentation overhead and different sampled position
  populations can affect phase averages; they are not a replacement for paired NPS.
- Report process-global profiling counters as deltas over each measured workload.
  Exclude earlier tests and setup, and run measurement windows serially so unrelated
  concurrent work cannot enter the same counters.

### NPS and search shape

Use `tools/benchmark_search.py` for throughput and
`nix run .#search-shape-benchmark` for depth, nodes, elapsed time, and tree-shape changes.
Disable the opening book unless book behavior is the subject of the test.

For Syzygy throughput comparisons, choose roots that enter tablebases inside the search:
an eligible root can return immediately with zero nodes, which has no meaningful NPS.
Confirm complete WDL/DTZ files loaded for both binaries, count interior probe attempts
and successes with an untimed diagnostic build, and report node counts and search time
alongside NPS because tablebase scores can change the search tree.

For SMP work, cover `Threads=1,2,4,8,12` when the machine has at least 12 logical CPUs. Do not
request more active threads than the hardware can execute when judging scaling. Record both
total NPS and scaling relative to one thread. Also inspect reached depth and node count:
higher NPS can accompany a worse tree, and lower NPS can accompany better pruning.

Use at least three repeats for meaningful before/after measurements. If the delta is close
to run-to-run noise, rerun rather than declaring a regression or improvement. CI's quick NPS
job is a smoke test, not an Elo or performance proof.

For selective-search heuristics, instrument candidate eligibility and the complete outcome
before tuning thresholds. Record the context, verification cost, resulting action, and a
stable position identifier, then label a representative sample with a deeper independent
oracle. A verification that changes no search decision is still overhead; report total
verification nodes, action rate, and nodes per useful action. Keep raw traces and tool,
engine, and corpus hashes with the experiment so later threshold changes can be compared
against the same evidence.

Treat speculative verification as read-only until its result is accepted. It may reuse
valid descendant TT entries, but a rejected probe must not write descendant TT results,
train history, killers, or counter moves, or recursively start the same experiment. Check
the no-action invariant explicitly: when every candidate is rejected, a fixed-depth real
search must not change merely because verification ran.

Compile experimental per-node bookkeeping out of production when its policy is disabled.
A search-debug runtime switch is not enough if release search still updates path state or
collects evidence on every node. Confirm the absence of hidden scaffolding cost with a
release NPS and search-shape comparison.

### PGO release builds

All shipped binaries are built with profile-guided optimization. PGO changes compiler
layout and inlining decisions only, never program semantics, so it counts as a pure
speedup: every PGO binary must reproduce the plain build's bench signature and node
counts exactly, and adoption still needs the standard paired NPS comparison.

- Local Windows builds: first fetch the pinned compact tables with
  `python tools/fetch_syzygy_ci.py --out-dir pgo-data/syzygy-ci`, then run
  `python tools/build_pgo.py --syzygy-path pgo-data/syzygy-ci` (instrumented build into
  `target-pgo`, deterministic fixed-depth bench and real Syzygy root workloads,
  merge with `llvm-profdata` into `pgo-data/merged.profdata`, rebuild with
  `-Cprofile-use` into `target-pgo-use`,
  signature comparison against the plain binary). Requires
  `rustup component add llvm-tools`. Profiles are local artifacts (`pgo-data/` is
  gitignored); regenerate them after meaningful engine changes.
- CI: the `windows-msvc` job builds its artifact through `tools/build_pgo.py`. The Nix
  release packages build per-architecture profiles first
  (`nix/ember-pgo-profile.nix` for Linux plus the Windows consumers, and
  `nix/macos-ember-pgo-profile.nix` for macOS) and reuse the same-arch profile across
  OS builds: PGO data is function-level counting over target-independent IR, so a
  Linux-built profile serves the Windows build of the same architecture. Cross-arch
  profiling runs the workload under QEMU user emulation or Rosetta; counters are exact
  under emulation, only wall time grows.
- The Nix `ci` shell, plain CI test builds, and the fixture-gate baseline stay plain
  (no PGO) and act as the portability and correctness gate.
- Verify with the paired-NPS workflow above on the same machine before and after.
- Include representative inputs for hot optional subsystems in the PGO workload.
  In particular, plain bench positions do not exercise the Syzygy decoder.
  Check that `llvm-profdata show --counts` records nonzero decoder execution,
  then compare tablebase-loaded search NPS and a Syzygy-disabled control.
- For runtime-dispatched kernels, train and verify each reachable feature path in
  a fresh process. Check actual profile execution counts, not just the presence of
  the functions. Explicit QEMU CPU models can verify fallback correctness and
  collect profiles, but cannot supply native performance evidence.

### Elo and game comparisons

Choose the harness that matches the question:

- `tools/head_to_head.py` compares two Ember configurations directly with paired book
  starts and colors.
- `tools/compare_versions.py` compares two Ember revisions against identical seeded
  scenarios drawn from stronger and weaker external opponents, real time controls, opening
  starts, and ponder settings. Its changed-outcome list is a triage queue for deeper
  analysis.
- `tools/measure_elo.py` estimates strength against the configured opponent pool or a
  calibrated Stockfish level.

Always report games, wins/draws/losses, score, Elo estimate, confidence interval, LOS when
available, color split, and termination reasons. Do not call a small WDL difference an
improvement without statistical support. For paired external-opponent tests, compute
uncertainty over paired scenarios rather than pretending every game is independent.

Use pentanomial SPRT when a head-to-head match should stop sequentially. Define the Elo
indifference interval, alpha, beta, minimum pair count, and maximum pair count before the
match. Count paired-opening outcomes from 0 through 2 points and inspect the recorded LLR
and bounds. Repeatedly checking an ordinary fixed-sample p-value after each batch does not
preserve its advertised false-positive rate and must not be presented as an SPRT result.

For a candidate-versus-incumbent SPRT, make the engine-side orientation and Elo sign
explicit. Regression-test that a candidate is adopted only when the positive candidate
hypothesis is accepted; accepting the null/equality hypothesis is not evidence that a
candidate improved.

Treat output from an adaptive optimizer as discovery rather than final evidence. Before
starting discovery, predeclare one independent full-candidate confirmation with fresh data
and a stricter false-positive rate. Derive its run identity from the candidate, binary, and
complete test configuration so an interrupted or repeated invocation resumes the same
evidence instead of rerolling the statistical test.

Leave head-to-head workers on `auto` unless the experiment deliberately reserves or
oversubscribes CPUs. Automatic concurrency must account for each engine's UCI `Threads`
setting: only one side normally searches at a time, so the per-game CPU cost is the larger
engine thread count. Keep several games queued per worker inside each statistical batch so
one long game does not create an avoidable idle tail. Prefer dynamic queueing to static
opening-cost guesses: starting-position material is a poor predictor of the trajectory and
duration of a chess game. Never reorder scenarios across SPRT boundaries, because a cost
estimate can correlate with game outcome and bias sequential stopping. Record the resolved
worker count and batch size with the result artifacts.

When a candidate has worsened outcomes, locate the first Ember move that differs from the
baseline and analyze both choices with strong Stockfish. Compare the immediate balance and
several subsequent moves. Look for a repeated signature across games before changing a
general heuristic.

### Clock safety

Time-management and SMP changes require clocked matches in addition to fixed-depth tests.
Include an extreme increment control such as `1+0.01`, a representative short control such
as `8+0.08`, and a less compressed control when practical. Inspect time forfeits separately
from chess losses.

Give hard-deadline expiration one owner. Recursive search should consume a shared stop token
without reading the wall clock or implementing a second polling schedule. Validate the owner
with stale-registration, replacement, disarm, already-expired, and shutdown races, and cover
fresh tokens for reused searchers and persistent SMP workers. Exercise short synchronous UCI
searches, longer asynchronous searches, `stop`, immediate restart, and ponder transitions.

Measure timer wake lateness separately from time to return `bestmove`. A watchdog can request
search cancellation while another thread runs, but it cannot make a descheduled search thread
or process execute. Keep an evidence-based low-clock reserve for scheduler and protocol tails,
and preserve the games and per-move times that justified it. Characterize watchdog latency on
each shipped platform under idle and controlled-load conditions; do not replace missing native
platform measurements with cross-build success.

For selected games, record time spent and time remaining per move. Check that search stops
within its hard budget, workers become idle promptly after `bestmove`, ponder transitions do
not leak work, and obvious forced replies do not receive pathological budgets. Opponent time
may inform strategy only through explicit, tested policy; never assume the opponent clock is
already incorporated.

## Commit and history discipline

- Make each commit one accomplished, reviewable part of the work. Separate fixtures/tests,
  engine behavior, tooling, Nix opponents, packaging, and documentation when they are
  independently meaningful.
- Put regression coverage in a separate commit from the behavioral fix when practical.
  Keep submitted history coherent and buildable. For a known move weakness that cannot yet
  be fixed safely, add a commented fixture rather than making every intermediate commit red.
- If the starting code is unformatted, format it in a dedicated first commit. Do not hide
  logic changes in formatting noise.
- Fold late compile, CI, or packaging corrections into the commit that introduced the
  problem before publication. Avoid a visible back-and-forth sequence when the final design
  can be expressed directly.
- Write imperative subjects. Use the body to explain the invariant, cause, and important
  trade-off, not to narrate every edit. Wrap commit-description lines.
- Before committing, inspect the staged diff and verify that the description matches it.
- Keep `docs/README.ru.md` synchronized with `README.md` in the same commit. The Russian
  file is a full translation of the same document, so every shared element (a badge, an
  external URL, a pinned version, a ratings table, a command, a section order) belongs in
  both files together. Only the prose language and the `../` prefix on repository-local
  asset paths differ. Never update one README and leave the other showing stale metadata;
  a badge that still advertises a superseded toolchain pin is a documentation bug, not a
  cosmetic difference.
- Do not commit PR prose, scratch plans, downloaded reports, PGNs/results, tablebase
  archives, torrents, build outputs, or generated packages unless the repository explicitly
  tracks that artifact.
- Never rewrite commits below a user-specified boundary. After a rebase, add new commits
  unless the user explicitly authorizes another history rewrite.

## Release versioning

- Treat the `[package].version` in `Cargo.toml` as the canonical Ember version. Keep
  `Cargo.lock` and user-visible packaging metadata synchronized with it. The UCI
  `id name Ember <version>` response is derived from the package version at compile time
  and needs no separate bump.
- Bump and verify every version-bearing location before creating a release tag. Build the
  release candidate from that exact commit and check its UCI handshake before tagging. Never
  tag first and apply the version bump afterward; the tagged source archive and attached
  binaries must identify the same release.

## Nix, opponents, and Syzygy

- Keep Nix inputs reproducible: pin exact upstream revisions and hashes. Do not silently
  replace an opponent binary or source release under the same package definition.
- When upgrading the pinned Rust nightly, update the Rust toolchain file, the pinned
  `rust-overlay` input, explicit CI toolchain references, and build documentation together.
  Build the same source with both toolchains and compare both plain and shipped PGO binaries
  with interleaved NPS runs; report compiler versions, build flags, node counts, and run-to-run
  spread. Merge PGO profiles with `llvm-profdata` from that Rust toolchain; the Nix LLVM package
  can use a different raw profile format. Resolve host-tool paths using Rust's host triple,
  which may differ from Nix's platform config (notably on Apple Silicon), and check the tool
  exists before starting an instrumented build.
- After changing a Rust dependency, regenerate the locked third-party license report with
  the command in `about.toml` and run its CI comparison. Keep original upstream notices
  from maintained forks and translated libraries, and check that release
  archives carry the notice files.
- Add opponent packages separately from the comparison or test that consumes them. This
  keeps licensing/build review distinct from experimental methodology.
- Treat Syzygy manifests as exact datasets. Verify file counts, WDL/DTZ pairing, store paths,
  and material coverage. Test `3-4-5-6` against `3-4-5` or no Syzygy as complete
  configurations, not as a misleading six-piece-only directory.
- When a dependency package contains multiple files with the same SPDX license,
  pin each required notice with checksummed `cargo-about` clarifications. Check
  notices for bundled native code separately from its Rust wrapper, and verify
  the generated report on another machine before shipping it.
- When using a small six- or seven-piece sample, check that every root move and
  recursive DTZ successor stays within the available tables. A pawn promotion
  can require another table of the same cardinality. Use direct WDL/DTZ probes
  for a sample without successor closure, and reserve root comparisons for a
  closed sample. Record missing-table failures separately from probe defects.
- When copying a Nix tablebase output to another host, dereference its absolute
  store symlinks or build the output there. Verify that the destination has
  readable table files before interpreting a probe failure.
- When changing a tablebase backend, verify that it discovers each material split in the
  manifest, not just the maximum piece count. Probe real positions from those splits at
  both root and interior nodes; a successful path load can still omit a whole class of
  tables and silently change the search tree.
- Keep tablebase directories immutable while any loaded generation may probe them. Capture
  one generation at search setup, publish replacements for later searches, and release
  retired references from persistent workers after each job. Test reloads with distinct
  directories instead of overwriting files that may still be opened lazily.
- When a safe Rust API wraps a translated unsafe decoder, reject malformed piece masks,
  pawn ranks, and en-passant squares before raw indexing. For shared probe state, audit
  reference creation as well as writes: `&mut` and `as_mut_ptr()` on published data
  claim exclusive access even when the caller only reads. Exercise first-load and
  concurrent steady-state probes with real tables.
- Use the hash-pinned `syzygy-ci` target for mandatory small real-table probes on both
  Linux CI architectures. Select those tests explicitly with `SYZYGY_CI_PATH`; keep
  full-set and six-piece tests separate so sparse tables cannot silently skip a
  required assertion or trigger probes of missing successor tables.

## Definition of done

A change is done when:

- the cause is understood well enough to justify the implementation;
- the appropriate regression exists and passes;
- formatting, tests, and relevant platform checks pass;
- NPS/search shape and Elo/clock gates appropriate to the risk show no unexplained
  degradation;
- raw evidence is preserved and the exact comparison configuration is documented;
- commits are atomic, accurately described, and free of unrelated files;
- requested outputs are produced and verified.

If a gate cannot be run, say exactly which one and why. Do not replace missing evidence with
confidence language.
